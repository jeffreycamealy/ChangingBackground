ChangingBackground - Coding Challenge
==================
## Inspiration
Dryv is a growing Chicago startup that provides high quality on demand dry cleaning.  Ora Interactive has 
built the [iOS App](http://orainteractive.com/dryv) that is currently running in private beta.

The application utilizes a subtle background color change throughout the user flow.  A demonstration of the effect can 
be seen below.  Notice how the background slowly changes from blue to green as the user progresses through the application.

between two view controllers.  
+ The background color image assets needed are also provided.  

A demo of the solution is shown
below.
