ChangingBackground - Coding Challenge
==================
## Inspiration
Dryv is a growing startup that provides high quality on demand dry cleaning.  Ora Interactive 
built the [iOS App](http://orainteractive.com/dryv) that is currently [live](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dryv/id661821366?mt=8) and in use in Chicago.

The application utilizes a subtle background color change throughout the user flow.  A demonstration of the effect can 
be seen below.  Notice how the background slowly changes from blue to green as the user progresses through the application.

## Challenge
Your challenge is to recreate the main color change functionality.  
+ This repository contains a basic setup that transitions 
between two view controllers.  
+ The background color image assets needed are also provided. 
+ Note that this effect has been made more difficult by a change to Cocoa's implementation of UINavigationControllers.  You may need to modify the behavior to get the effect to work with Apples update.

A demo of the solution is shown
below.
